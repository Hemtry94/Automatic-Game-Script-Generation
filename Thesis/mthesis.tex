\ThesisTitle{Automatic Game Script Generation}

\ThesisKeywords{Procedural Content Generation; Computational Creativity; Rule Generation; Level Generation; Puzzle Script; Puzzle Games}

\ThesisSummary{Procedural Content Generation has been in industry since the early days of Video Games. It was used to support huge amount of data with a small footprint due to technical limitations. Although technical difficulties become history, PCG is still one of the hot topics in Video Games Industry and Research. PCG helps us reduce development time and cost, and understand the process of creating game content. In this work, we propose a system to help in generating levels and rules for Puzzle Script engine. The system produces levels using several different approaches that have a trade off between speed (Constructive approach) and playability (Genetic approach). These levels are subjected to a group of heuristic measures that measures the level playability and challenge. The generated levels are 100\% playable levels in genetic Approach and 90\% in constructive approach. The results are subjected to human players. The automated scores and human scores are very much related. This relation proves that the proposed heuristic measures can be used as generic measure for game playability and challenge. Also, our system extends Lim et al. work in generating puzzle rules. It uses the constructive approach level generator to generate levels for any generated rules. The results are playable but it takes long time. These results is a good indication for doing more research in that field.}
