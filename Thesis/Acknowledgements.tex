I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Micheal Cook. His wok on ANGELINA was my main inspiration to start working on Procedural Content Generation. I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Magda Fayek for all the support, guidance, and extreme patience she provides. Without her support this work would not have seen the light. Also Thanks to all my friends for the support and the huge help in collecting human feedback on our results.
